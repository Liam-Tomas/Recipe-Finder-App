# Recipe Finder App
Welcome to the Recipe Finder App! This project is designed to help users find and share their favorite recipes. It's composed of a frontend developed using React and a backend service. Both parts are crucial to the functionality of the app.

## Structure
Frontend (recipe-react): This is the user interface of our application, where users can browse, search, and interact with recipes. Developed using React, it provides a dynamic and responsive experience.

Backend (recipe-backend): This part handles the data and logic behind the scenes. It manages user data, recipes, and ensures that everything runs smoothly.
